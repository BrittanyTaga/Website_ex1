<h1>Student View</h1>
<h2>In the Beginning</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    As a student, I started this competition by first choosing the Project Development team. 
    The reason for this was due to the amount of people wanting to be on the turbine team and from past experiences, having too many people on a team can be counterproductive. 
    I also have had experience with the wind blade software, Q-Blade, and wanted to give others a chance to learn the software. 
    Studying how different positioning of turbines, turbine models, and effects of the wind can have on energy output greatly interested me. 
    To study this, I took the lead on learning different software to create the wind farm. 
    The main software used to create the wind farm included System Advisor Model, SAM, and Continuum.
</p>

<h2>Positives</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Main ideas that I have learned:
    <ul>
        <li>Permitting and ordinances are currently the major game changers for a wind farm</li>
        <li>As a developer, only the state laws for Fish and Wildlife Services are to be respected</li>
        <li>I learned multiple softwares:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>SAM</li>
            <li>Conintuum</li>
            <li>Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>How to read wind roses</li>
        <li>How to read different terrains</li>
        <li>How to read wake loss maps</li>
        <li>Community outreach can also play a major role in getting approval for a wind farm</li>
        <li>Having funding from the bank and other government sources plays a key role in funding</li>
        <li>The biggest turbine is perferred due to needing less and decreasing the amount of turbines</li>
        <li>Sometimes, smaller turbines are good to implment as well and can have a higher power output</li>
        <li>State and local governments' laws/ordinaces/permitting needs more focus than Federal laws (in my opinion)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Negatives</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    As a student at NAU, there were no classes that I could have taken to help with understanding the wind industry. 
    Until this project, the only class that was close to learning about the energy industry was the preparatory writing class. 
    During that class, it did not give much detail on the industry. 
    For me, it felt like I was taking another English class for engineers. 
    I did not get to explore the wind industry or the energy industry as much due to the limitations of the class curriculum. 
    Although the class encouraged the students to explore on their own, it is very hard to do so with very little guidance. 
    While participating in this project, the amount of classes that I was taking amounted to 20 credits per semester. 
    I did not have the time I wanted to, to put into the project without having to worry about my grades falling. 
    During this time, I was heavily criticized despite providing most of the team deliverables and resources by myself, received little to no help for deliverables, 
    and had teammates who refused to cooperate during the project.
</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    Although I have separated this section into both positives and negatives, the time that I have spent learning
    about the renewable energy industry can not be replaced. I have also gained connections in the industry and
    can now confidently explain the process of creating a wind farm from scratch along with time estimations.
    This experience can not be replaced and I would have choosen to redo this project to learn more about
    the renewable energy industry, if I could.
