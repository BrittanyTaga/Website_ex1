<h1>My Senior Project Experience</h1>
<p>
    My name is Brittany Taga and I was the project lead for the Project Development Team at Northern Arizona University.
      I majored in Mechanical Engineering and Compariative Cultural Studies with an emphasis in Asian and North African Studies and did a study abroad in Japan at Kyushu University, Fukuoka.
      I created this website to not only create a working website but to also reflect on my experience with the Collegiate Wind Competition (CWC) hosted by the Department of Energy.
</p>

<p>
    For the 2020-2021 compeition, the teams were tasked with creating and designing a turbine, creating a project management plan for a 100MW wind farm in the western part of South Dakota,
    and to connect with people in the renewable energy industry along with an outreach to get younger people involved. 
    Note: Every year, the Department of Energy changes the rules. Therefore, the final deliverables varies from year to year.
</p>

<p>
    In the <b>About</b>, you can find more information about the competition along with specific rules for the 2020-2021 competition.
</p>

<p>
    In <b>Experience</b>, I talk about how I went through the competition as a student and as a Project Development lead.
</p>

<p>
    In <b>Offical Project Websites</b>, there are links to the turbine, project development, and electrical team's official school websites.
